# DW1-UI [powered by React App]

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
Basically, its a really basic UI wiki view for all the data related to Digimon World 1 (1999) PS1 game.
This is still an exploratory WIP (I am feeding the database), so it may get some data updates soon.
This UI consumes a service that currently is available at [Railway](https://railway.app/) (see [DW1-Service](https://github.com/gal16v8d/dw1-svc)) and then stores the data in cache, I am not keeping live the backend due some costs after starter plan is fully consumed, but it can live through a flag that enable mocking using [MSW](https://mswjs.io/). It should be up, but if is not the case, feel free to ping.
